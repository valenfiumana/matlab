# MATLAB Cheatsheets and Exercises
This repository contains a collection of cheatsheets and exercises for MATLAB, a widely used numerical computing and programming environment.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, you can use these resources to quickly reference key concepts, syntax, and functions, and to practice and reinforce your MATLAB skills.

This repository was created by me as part of Numeric Numbers subject at UNSAM University. Feel free to use these resources for your own learning, or to contribute your own cheatsheets, exercises, or solutions to the repository. </br> </br>

## Contents

The repository includes the following resources:
* **Cheatsheets**: A set of cheatsheets covering topics such as variables, arrays, operators, control flow, functions, graphics, and more. Each cheatsheet includes a brief overview of the topic, examples, and tips.

* **Exercises**: A set of MATLAB exercises covering a range of topics and difficulty levels. Each exercise includes a problem statement, sample input and output, and a solution (in the form of a MATLAB script).

* **Solutions**: A collection of solutions to the exercises, organized by topic and difficulty level. You can use these solutions to check your own solutions or to learn from different approaches.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone or download it to your local machine and open the files in MATLAB or your preferred text editor. You can print the cheatsheets and work through the exercises at your own pace. The solutions are provided for your reference, but you should try to solve the exercises on your own before looking at them.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository, you're welcome to do so! You can submit new cheatsheets, exercises, or solutions, or you can improve the existing ones by fixing errors, adding more examples, or providing clearer explanations. Please read the contribution guidelines for more information.


I hope that this repository will be a useful resource for anyone looking to learn or improve their MATLAB programming skills. Happy coding!
