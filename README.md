# MATLAB Cheatsheets and Exercises
MATLAB is a popular programming language for numerical computations and has a vast collection of tools for solving mathematical problems. The aim of this repository is to provide implementations of some common numerical methods in MATLAB that can be used as a reference or a starting point for further development.

This repository was created by me as part of Numeric Numbers subject at UNSAM University. Feel free to use these resources for your own learning, or to contribute your own cheatsheets and methods to the repository. </br> </br>

## Numerical Methods

The numerical methods included in this repository are:

- Root Finding Methods
  - [Bisection Method](./metodos/funciones/biseccion.m)
  - [Newton-Raphson Method](./metodos/funciones/newtonraphson.m)

## Usage

To use the functions and algorithms included in this repository, simply download or clone the repository and add the folder to your MATLAB path. Each method is implemented as a separate function, which can be called from the command line or used in a script or function.
